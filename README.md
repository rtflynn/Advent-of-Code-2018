Welcome to my 2018 Advent of Code solutions.  This is my first year trying Advent of Code - and I have to say, it's really fun and educational.  It reminds me a lot of the google foo.bar challenge, for anyone who's tried that out.

I don't plan on discussing individual solutions here - however, I'm happy to explain a particular solution if someone has a question.
