Welcome to my 2018 Advent of Code solutions.  This is my first year trying Advent of Code - and I have to say, it's really fun and educational.  It reminds me a lot of the google foo.bar challenge, for anyone who's tried that out.  Perhaps the biggest difference between the two is that with the foo.bar challenge, you actually upload code and google runs it on a set of test cases, whereas with the Advent of Code challenges, you're given a general problem together with a *particular* instance of that problem, and you have to figure out the answer in that particular case.  This is an important difference because, while brute force will essentially never work with the foo.bar challenge (except maybe in the first few problems), brute force *can* work with AoC.  Regardless, I've tried to make sure each solution presented here runs quickly.

The problems themselves can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2018 .  I have to say here that they're written very playfully, and I'd recommend anyone who's stumbled onto this page but who hasn't seen the AoC challenge to give this link a visit!

I don't plan on discussing individual solutions here - however, I'm happy to explain a particular solution if someone has a question.
